        A pearl is a treasured possession. Jesus used the metaphor of pearls to
        explain what happens when someone receives the gift of eternal life:
      </p>
      <p class="lead"><i>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine
        pearls, who, on finding one pearl of great value, went and sold all that
        he had and bought it</i> (Matthew 13:45-46). </p>
      <p class="lead"><i>Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee
        (Psalm 119:11)</i>
