      <h1>Understanding my new identity in Christ</h1>

<section class="article">
  <p class="lead">
    Many people today have been broken through devestation experiences. The
    things that people say to you are the worse, especially if they were
    people that were once close to you. Angry people act recklessly. They
    speak to hurt and sometimes don't even mean what they say. But deep scars
    are left that affect you for a lifetime. We are shaped by words, attitudes,
    and behaviour of significant people like parent, family, teachers, or
    employers. Today, if someone would ask you, "who are you really?", you may
    feel unsure or uncomfortable. But there is one significant and reliable
    person whose words and actions could change your life...
  <p>
  <p class="scripture">For I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD,
    plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope. Then
    you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will hear you. You will
    seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart. I will be found
    by you, declares the LORD (Jeremiah 29:11-14).</p>
  <p>Discover with me what Christ has said about you and what He thinks about
    you.

        <p>The story of your life started even before you were born. When your
          mother conceived you, you were already in God's mind. Take note of
          these words of David, the Psalmist: "For you formed my inward parts;
          you knitted me together in my mother's womb" (Psalm 139:13). You were
          planned by God and designed by God. He created you in His image
          (Genesis 1:27) to live in fellowship with Him (Philippians 3:8).
        </p>
        <p>Being created by God means that you are significant. You have a
          purpose. You have a destiny, and you belong to your Heavenly Father.
          He will not reject you. "And the LORD, He is the One who goes before
          you. He will be with you; He will not leave you nor forsake you; do
          not fear nor be dismayed” (Deuteronomy 31:8). If you received Jesus
          Christ, you are a child of God.
        </p>
        <p class="scripture">But to all who did receive him, who believed in his
          name, he gave the right to become children of God, who were born, not
          of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of
          God (John 1:12).
        </p>
        <p>When I become a child of God, my Heavenly Father is my new reference
          point. Everything He says about me tells me who I am. Even if
          everyone else rejects me, it does not matter any more. I have an
          inheritance that is mine forever.
        <p>
        <p class="scripture">But when the fullness of time had come, God sent
          forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, to redeem those who
          were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons. And
          because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our
          hearts, crying, “Abba! Father!” So you are no longer a slave, but a
          son, and if a son, then an heir through God. (Galations 4:4-7)
