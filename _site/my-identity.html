      <h1>Understanding my new identity in Christ</h1>

<section class="article">
  <p class="lead">
    Many people today have been broken through devestation experiences. The
    things that people say to you are the worse, especially if they were
    people that were once close to you. Angry people act recklessly. They
    speak to hurt and sometimes don't even mean what they say. But deep scars
    are left that affect you for a lifetime. We are shaped by words, attitudes,
    and behaviour of significant people like parent, family, teachers, or
    employers. Today, if someone would ask you, "who are you really?", you may
    feel unsure or uncomfortable. But there is one significant and reliable
    person whose words and actions could change your life...
  <p>
  <p class="scripture">For I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD,
    plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope. Then
    you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will hear you. You will
    seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart. I will be found
    by you, declares the LORD (Jeremiah 29:11-14).</p>
  <p>Discover with me what Christ has said about you and what He thinks about
    you.

  <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
        <p>The story of your life started even before you were born. When your
          mother conceived you, you were already in God's mind. Take note of
          these words of David, the Psalmist: "For you formed my inward parts;
          you knitted me together in my mother's womb" (Psalm 139:13). You were
          planned by God and designed by God. He created you in His image
          (Genesis 1:27) to live in fellowship with Him (Philippians 3:8).
        </p>
        <p>Being created by God means that you are significant. You have a
          purpose. You have a destiny, and you belong to your Heavenly Father.
          He will not reject you. "And the LORD, He is the One who goes before
          you. He will be with you; He will not leave you nor forsake you; do
          not fear nor be dismayed” (Deuteronomy 31:8). If you received Jesus
          Christ, you are a child of God.
        </p>
        <p class="scripture">But to all who did receive him, who believed in his
          name, he gave the right to become children of God, who were born, not
          of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of
          God (John 1:12).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-0 col-sm-0">
        <p>When I become a child of God, my Heavenly Father is my new reference
          point. Everything He says about me tells me who I am. Even if
          everyone else rejects me, it does not matter any more. I have an
          inheritance that is mine forever.
        <p>
        <p class="scripture">But when the fullness of time had come, God sent
          forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, to redeem those who
          were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons. And
          because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our
          hearts, crying, “Abba! Father!” So you are no longer a slave, but a
          son, and if a son, then an heir through God. (Galations 4:4-7)
        </p>
        <p>I invite you to respond to this realisation by thanking God for what
          He has done for you. On the cross Jesus removed the barrier that
          prevented spontaneous communication and direct access to God. See the
          invitation directly from God's Word:
        </p>
        <p class="scripture">Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne
          of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of
          need. (Hebrews 4:16)</p>

  <h2 class="article-subheading">WE ARE AFFECTED BY WHAT HAPPENED IN PARADICE</h2>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
        <p>Paradice was both a catastrophe and a demonstration of Yahweh's
          goodness. It is possible that the creation narrative was contemplated
          by God for a long time. God knew that giving humankind a free choice
          involved the test of His eternal love and goodness.
        </p>
        <p class="scripture">And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, "You
          may surely eat of every tree of the garden, but of the tree of the
          knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you
          eat of it you shall surely die." (Genesis 2:16-17)
        </p>
        <p>Human reasoning could suggest that God had to choose between
          righteousness and love. However, God's goodness upheld both His
          righteousness and his love. His righteousness demanded that Adam's sin
          resulted in death. But the love of God moved him in an amazing
          demonstration of grace.
        </p>
        <p>Adam was hopeless. His disobedient was disastrous because God had
          spelt out the consequences clearly. Nevertheless, God demonstrated His
          love for Adam, and the whole of humankind, in an unimaginable way.
          Christ decided to die in our place. The unthinkable act of love was
          first prophesied by the prophet Isiah.
        <p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-0 col-sm-0">
        <p class="scripture">But he was pierced for our transgressions; he was
          crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought
          us peace, and with his wounds we are healed. All we like sheep have
          gone astray; we have turned – every one – to his own way; and the LORD
          has laid on him the iniquity of us all. (Isaiah 53:5,6)
        </p>
        <p class="scripture">
          Yet it was the will of the LORD to crush him; he has put him to grief;
          when his soul makes an offering for guilt, he shall see his offspring;
          he shall prolong his days; the will of the LORD shall prosper in his
          hand. (Isaiah 53:10)
        </p>
        <p>Then, after the death and resurrection of Christ, the apostle Paul
          reflected on what Christ had accomplished to restore humankind to
          himself..
        </p>
        <p class="scripture">...so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through
          faith — that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may have strength
          to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and
          height and depth, and to know the love of Christ that surpasses
          knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
          (Ephesians 3:17-19)

        <p>You may sincerely ask the question, how does my worth compare against
          the worth of other people? There is actually a problem with this
          question, because God's love for us of us did not discriminate against
          our successes or failures.
        </p>
        <p>When Jesus died on the cross, fulfilling the prophecies of God’s
          redeeming grace, he demonstrated your value. Your debt was cleared.
          Completely! The ransom price to rescue you from eternal death was the
          life of God’s Son, Jesus Christ. God cancelled your record of debt and
          nailed it to the cross - becaused you mattered to Him.
        </p>
        <p class="scripture">Because you are precious in my eyes, and honored,
          and I love you (Isaiah 43:4)
        </p>
        <p>Centuries before the Messiah came, God prepared the hearts of Israel,
          His chosen nation. He helped them to understand that they were
          unabled to keep their part of the covenant. They needed a new heart.
          And this is what happened when the church was born on the Day of
          Pentecost. What was impossible with man became possible with God.

          Everything you do is marvelously breathtaking.
          It simply amazes me to think about it!
          How thoroughly you know me, Lord!
          You even formed every bone in my body
          when you created me in the secret place;
          carefully, skillfully you shaped me from nothing to something.
          You saw who you created me to be before I became me!
          Before I’d ever seen the light of day, the number of days you planned for me
          were already recorded in your book.
          Every single moment you are thinking of me!
          How precious and wonderful to consider

          It is awesome to know that I was in God’s mind even before I was born!
          Unfortunately, we did not always acknowledge His love and goodness.
          The sinful world influenced our thinking and our actions. Before we
          accepted Jesus into our hearts, we were controlled by our sinful
          nature. We disregarded the uncomfortable warnings of our conscience.
          We were spiritually dead – separated from God and enslaved to sin.
          Nevertheless, God’s never-failing love pursued us through these years.
          Although our sins grieved the Holy Spirit, He drew us to Himself. Like
          the Good Shepherd, Jesus called us by our names. He called us
          "out of darkness into His marvellous light" (1 Peter 2:9).
        </p>
        <p>Pray with me and thank God for His goodness to us. Talk to Him now

          Dear Lord Jesus,</br>
          My heart longs for You, to be united to the One who pursued me
          while I was far from you. Oh God, Lover of my soul, I thank you that
          You came into my life. Today, I want to respond to your message of
          love. I want to love you and live for you. I want to love my brothers
          and sisters because you poured out your love in my heart. Lord Jesus,
          cause my heart to desire you with everything that is in me. Today,
          I again surrender to you my heart, my mind my body and my soul.
        </p>
        <p class="scripture">I will bless the LORD at all times; his praise
          shall continually be in my mouth. My soul makes its boast in the LORD;
          let the humble hear and be glad. Oh, magnify the LORD with me, and let
          us exalt his name together! (Psalm 34:1-3)

  <h2 class="article-subheading">HOW TO FOLLOW JESUS WITH A CLEAN CONSCIENCE</h2>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
        <p>Living with a clean conscience is a bridge that every Christian must
          cross at some stage in their life. God gave us a conscience to make us
          aware of the voice of the Holy Spirit. If we are not able to hear
          God's voice, we can't follow His directions. We must therefore learn
          about our spirit nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          When God takes possession of my heart, the Holy Spirit also convicts
          me of sin. He fills me with remorse for all rebellion in my life.
          He also gives me a genuine desire to repent of everything that
          offends the Holy Spirit. He wants to dwell in me, but He wants to live
          in a clean temple. Who can imagine that Almighty God wants to live in
          the heart of a human being? Recall the conversation between Jesus and
          Nicodemus:
        </p>
        <p class="scripture">"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born
          again he cannot see the kingdom of God." Nicodemus said to him, "How
          can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his
          mother's womb and be born?" Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to
          you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the
          kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that
          which is born of the Spirit is spirit." (John 3:3-6)
        </p>
        <p>When Christ enters my heart, the Holy Spirit confronts me of any
          iniquity in my life. Some of us struggle to live in obedience and
          often do not find the courage to do what we should be doing.
        </p>
        <p> If you identify with this battle, I want to encourage you that God
          has something greater in store for you! Consider the striking
          metaphor of the victorious life in Hebrews 4. It speaks of entering
          the Sabbath rest just as Joshua gave his people rest after entering
          the promised land.
        </p>
        <p class="scripture">So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the
          people of God, for whoever has entered God's rest has also rested from
          his works as God did from his. (Hebrews 4:9-10)
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-0 col-sm-0">
        <p>Do you know that your conscience is your friend? It makes you feel
          uneasy when you suppress the voice of the Holy Spirit. This is how the
          Holy Spirit uses your conscience to get your attention. To end this
          battle, you must repent! You must come to the place where you hate
          every evidence of sin in your life. You need to hate the distractions
          in your life that feed your sin nature. Christ wants to be on the
          throne of your life. You must die to sin to live! Paul understood this
          battle, and he tells us how he found victory.
        </p>
        <p class="scripture">I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer
          I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the
          flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself
          for me. (Galatians 2:20)
        </p>
        <p>Paul had to die so that Christ could live in Him! I urge you, dear
          brother and sister in Christ, to discover the secret of life in
          Romans 8:1-17. Would you please read it like a prospector carefully
          looks for a diamond? Paul teaches here about living without
          condemnation, walking according to the Spirit, experiencing life and
          peace, pleasing God, being led by the Spirit, and becoming heirs of
          God and fellow heirs with Christ.
        </p>
        <p>Jesus is calling us to a place of total surrender. He wants to dwell
          in us as our Comforter. He wants to walk with me and talk with me.
          There is no other way to victory. We were born to have continual
          fellowship with the living God. We were meant to be sons and daughters
          of God!
        </p>
        <p>The conviction of the Holy Spirit calls us to repentance and life,
          but the condemnation of the adversary leads to bondage and death.
        </p>
        <p class="scripture">"Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty
          hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you, casting all
          your anxieties on him, because he cares for you." (I Peter 5:6)
