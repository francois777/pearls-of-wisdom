      <h1>How can I be saved?</h1>

<section class="article">
  <p class="lead">
    Very early in my Christian walk, I enrolled for a one-year programme with
    Youth for Christ, South Africa. One of our important commitments was to
    travel, as a group, to a crowded area in a large city. We would sing together
    at places where crowds could gather. The people that were not singing
    introduced themselves to people in the crowd and handed them a little
    yellow booklet called, <b><em>The Four Spiritual Laws</em></b>. We would
    explain these significant laws with people and help them to receive Jesus
    Christ as their personal Saviour.
  </p>
  <p>I want to introduce you to the content of this yellow track, but I first
    want to talk to you about salvation. The question that sooner or later
    confronts every person is <b>How can I be saved?</b>. The mission of Jesus
    Christ, the Son of God, was extraordinary. He left His Heavenly dwelling to
    become a human being. This is the story of God, reaching out to human
    beings. When we are confronted with the reality of this historical event, the
    Holy Spirit convicts us, deep inside, that we need to respond to this message.
  </p>
  <p>Have you responded yet to the message of Jesus Christ? If this has not
    happened yet in your life, do you know how to respond to him? Maybe, you
    have already made this important decision, but you want to help a friend or
    stranger to make this commitment. Do you know how to help someone to
    invite Jesus into their life?
  </p>
  <p>The following link will take you directly to the contents of this booklet.

      Read about the Four Spiritual Laws
    </a>
  </p>
  <p>Let us take a look at the four steps:
    <ol>
      <li><b>Step 1:</b> God loves you and created you to know Him personally.
      </li>
      <li><b>Step 2:</b> Man is sinful and separated from God, so we cannot know
        Him personally or experience His love.</li>
      <li><b>Step 3:</b> Jesus Christ is God's only provision for man's sin.
        Through Him alone we can know God personally and experience God's love.
      </li>
      <li><b>Step 4:</b> We must individually receive Jesus Christ as Savior and
        Lord; then we can know God personally and experience His love.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    Each of the four steps are deeply grounded in the Word of God. Take time to
    become familiar with the contents and all the included Bible references. It
    is also important to know that after we invited Jesus into our lives, we
    need to commit ourselves to a group of believers. To keep on growing as
    disciples, we need to seek the fellowship of other believers.
