      <h1>Fundamental Doctrine of the Bible</h1>

<section class="article">
  <p class="lead">
    Spiritual growth starts when the Holy Spirit enters a believer’s heart. The
    Holy Spirit, who is your Comforter and Helper, lives in you. He teaches you the
    ways of God and reminds you of everything that Jesus taught. He imprints in your
    heart, the character of God – Merciful, Gracious, Compassionate, Slow to anger,
    Abounding in steadfast love, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin.
  </p>

  <p>
    A transformation takes place when you prayerfully meditate on God’s righteous
    decrees. The Holy Spirit changes you from within, enabling you to live a
    victorious Christian life. It pleases the Father to restore His image in you
    and shine His light through you.
  </p>
  <p class="scripture">
    God intends to build up the body of Christ "until we all attain to the unity
    of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the
    measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ" (Eph 4:13, ESV).
  </p>
  <p>
    We all therefore need a solid foundation as the basis of our growth. See how
    the book of Hebrews describe this foundation:
  </p>
  <p class="scripture">
    Now is the time for us to progress beyond the basic message of Christ and
    advance into perfection. The foundation has already been laid for us to
    build upon: turning away from our dead works to embrace <b>faith in God</b>,
    teaching about different <b>baptisms</b>, impartation by the <b>laying on of
    hands</b>, <b>resurrection of the dead</b>, and <b>eternal judgment</b>.
    So with God’s enablement we will move on to deeper truths. (Hebrews 6:1-3, TPT).
  </p>

  <h2 class="article-subheading">FAITH IN GOD</h2>

  <p>An indisputable part of our Christian foundation is FAITH IN GOD.</p>

  <p class="scripture">Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as
    righteousness (James 2:23, ESV).</p>

  <p>Faith implies a measure of personal trust in something beyond your natural
    reasoning and abilities. From childhood, we learn to become independent and
    take responsibility for our own safety, provision and well-being. We learn
    to rely on our own judgement. Trusting God for my salvation challenges the
    securities with which I surrounded my life. Consider the implications of
    this proverb: </p>

  <p class="scripture">Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on
    your own understanding (Proverbs 3:5, ESV). </p>

  <p>
    Recommended for discussion:
    <ul>
      <li>To what extent has faith matured in your life?</li>
      <li>Has your faith ever been tested?</li>
      <li>How would you explain faith to an unbeliever?</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2 class="article-subheading">BAPTISMS</h2>
  <h3>1. The baptism of John the Baptist</h3>

   <p class="scripture">Now John wore a garment of camel's hair and a leather belt
     around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. Then Jerusalem
     and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were going out to him, and
     <b>they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins</b>
     (Matthew 3:4-6, ESV)</p>

   <p>The baptism of John was a prophetic event, proclaiming the arrival of
     someone much greater than he. He warned the people of Israel to repent of
     their sins and turn away from evil so that their sins may be forgiven. When
     some thought that John could be the Christ, he answered them:

   <p class="scripture">I baptize you with water, but he who is mightier than I
     is coming, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. <b>He will
     baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire</b> (Luke 3:16, ESV).</p>

   <p>His ministry reached its climax when Jesus came and requested that He also
     be baptised. </p>

   <p class="scripture">Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus
     also had been baptized and was praying, the heavens were opened, and the
     Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form, like a dove; and a voice came
     from heaven, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased
     (Luke 3:21-22, ESV).</p>

  <h3>2. Water baptism - the sign of accepting the message of Jesus Christ</h3>
  <p>The apostle Peter concluded his sermon on the day of Pentecost with these
    words:</p>

  <p class="scripture">"...Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain
    that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.”
    Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and
    the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?” And Peter said to
    them, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
    for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy
    Spirit. For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are
    far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself.” And with many
    other words he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, “Save
    yourselves from this crooked generation.” So <b>those who received his word
    were baptized</b>, and there were added that day about three thousand souls.
    (Acts 2:36-41) </p>

  <p>It was the departing instruction of Jesus Christ to His eleven disciples to
    go and make disciples of all nations. The baptism of believers is accompanied
    by the teaching of the message of Jesus Christ. Those who accept His message
    must be baptised and must be obedient.</p>

  <p class="scripture">And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven
    and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all
    nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the
    Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And
    behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age” (Matthew 28:18-20).</p>

  <p>Baptism, for believers, is also a symbol of identifying with the death and
    resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>

  <p class="scripture">Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into
    Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried therefore with him
    by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead
    by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life
    (Romans 6:3-4) </p>

  <h2 class="article-subheading">THE LAYING ON OF HANDS</h2>

  <p>Jesus laid his hands on sick people and by the authority of His Word they
    were healed. This reminds us of how Jahweh created everything in the
    beginning.
  </p>

  <p class="scripture">Then came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by
    name, and seeing him, he fell at his feet and implored him earnestly, saying,
    “My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her,
    so that she may be made well and live” (Mark 5:22-23). </p>
  <p class="scripture">When Jesus saw her, he called her over and said to her,
    “Woman, you are freed from your disability.” And he laid his hands on her,
    and immediately she was made straight, and she glorified God (Luke 13:12,13).
  </p>

  <p>The disciples laid their hands on people so that they would receive the
  Holy Spirit. In the church, today, the laying on of hands imparted a gift of
  God. This gift could take the form of healing, or the infilling of the
  Holy Spirit. </p>

  <p class="scripture">As I remember your tears, I long to see you, that I may be
    filled with joy. I am reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that dwelt
    first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am sure,
    dwells in you as well. For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the
    gift of God, <b>which is in you through the laying on of my hands</b>
    (2 Timothy 1:4-6) </p>
