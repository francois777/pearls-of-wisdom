      <h1>Fundamental Doctrine of the Bible</h1>

<section class="article">
  <p class="lead">
    Spiritual growth starts when the Holy Spirit enters a believer’s heart. The
    Holy Spirit, who is your Comforter and Helper, lives in you. He teaches you
    the ways of God and reminds you of everything that Jesus taught. We need a
    firm foundation to stand against the deception of false doctrines. To be
    effective disciples, we also need to be confident in what we believe. The
    fundamental doctrines will help us to be mature followers of Jesus Christ.
  </p>

  <p>All Scripture references in this article use the English Standard Version
    unless otherwise stated.

  <p>
  A transformation takes place when you prayerfully meditate on God’s righteous
  decrees. The Holy Spirit changes you from within, enabling you to live a
  victorious Christian life. It pleases the Father to restore His image in you
  and shine His light through you.
</p>
<p class="scripture">
  God intends to build up the body of Christ "until we all attain to the unity
  of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the
  measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ" (Eph 4:13).
</p>
<p>
  We all therefore need a solid foundation as the basis of our growth. See how
  the book of Hebrews describe this foundation:
</p>
<p class="scripture">
  Now is the time for us to progress beyond the basic message of Christ and
  advance into perfection. The foundation has already been laid for us to
  build upon: turning away from our dead works to embrace <b>faith in God</b>,
  teaching about different <b>baptisms</b>, impartation by the <b>laying on of
  hands</b>, <b>resurrection of the dead</b>, and <b>eternal judgment</b>.
  So with God’s enablement we will move on to deeper truths. (Hebrews 6:1-3, TPT).
</p>
<p> The purpose of this article is to explain the doctrines listed above.
  Having laid this foundation in our lives, we must grow toward spiritual
  maturity. I would strongly encourage all readers to study this material as a
  group. There is immeasurable value in the interactive participation of a group
  of Christians, sharing and learning from each other.

  <h2 class="article-subheading">FAITH IN GOD</h2>

  <p>An indisputable part of our Christian foundation is FAITH IN GOD.</p>

  <p class="scripture">Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as
    righteousness (James 2:23, ESV).</p>

  <p>Faith implies a measure of personal trust in something beyond your natural
    reasoning and abilities. From childhood, we learn to become independent and
    take responsibility for our own safety, provision and well-being. We learn
    to rely on our own judgement. Trusting God for my salvation challenges the
    securities with which I surrounded my life. Consider the implications of
    this proverb: </p>

  <p class="scripture">Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on
    your own understanding (Proverbs 3:5, ESV). </p>

<<<<<<< HEAD
  <p>Faith is directly related to the proclamation of the word of Christ.
=======
  <p>Faith is directly related to the proclamation of the word of Christ. It is
  the testimony of many Christians that their lives were deeply affected when
  they believed in God. When I encountered Christ as a young man at university,
  I experienced an instant transformation. I responded to the inner conviction
  of the Holy Spirit by praying the most important prayer I ever prayed, inviting
  Jesus into my life. After I prayed, I truly believed. I knew that I changed
  and that my life would never be the same again.
>>>>>>> master
  </p>

  <p class="scripture">For “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be
  saved.” How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how
  are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to
  hear without someone preaching? And how are they to preach unless they are
  sent? As it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the
  good news!” But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, “Lord,
  who has believed what he has heard from us?” So faith comes from hearing, and
  hearing through the word of Christ (Romans 10:13-17).</p>

  <p>We exercise faith to trust God for our salvation. Then, throughout our
  lives, faith is an essential part of our living and breathing as God's
  children. Whenever we pray, we trust God that He will reward those who
  earnestly seek him wholeheartedly.
  </p>

  <p class="scripture">And without faith it is impossible to please him, for
  whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards
  those who seek him (Hebrews 11:6) </p>

  <h3>1. The baptism of John the Baptist</h3>

<<<<<<< HEAD
<p class="scripture">Now John wore a garment of camel's hair and a leather belt
   around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. Then Jerusalem
   and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were going out to him, and
   <b>they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins</b>
   (Matthew 3:4-6, ESV)</p>

<p>The book of Matthew describes the unique ministry of John the Baptist, the
one, anointed by God to prepare the way of the Messiah.</p>

<p class="scripture">In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the
wilderness of Judea, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” For this is
he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said, “The voice of one
crying in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of the Lord; make his paths
straight.’” <br><br>
Now John wore a garment of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist, and
is food was locusts and wild honey. Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the
region about the Jordan were going out to him, and <b>they were baptized by him
in the river Jordan, confessing their sins</b> (Matthew 3:1-6, ESV)</p>
>>>>>>> master

<p>The baptism of John was a prophetic event, proclaiming the arrival of
   someone much greater than he. He warned the people of Israel to repent of
   their sins and turn away from evil so that their sins may be forgiven. When
   some thought that John could be the Christ, he answered them:

<p class="scripture">I baptize you with water, but he who is mightier than I
   is coming, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. <b>He will
   baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire</b> (Luke 3:16, ESV).</p>

<p>His ministry reached its climax when Jesus came and requested that He also
   be baptised. </p>

<p class="scripture">Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus
   also had been baptized and was praying, the heavens were opened, and the
   Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form, like a dove; and a voice came
   from heaven, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased
   (Luke 3:21-22, ESV).</p>

  <h3>2. Water baptism - the sign of accepting the message of Jesus Christ</h3>
<p>The apostle Peter concluded his sermon on the day of Pentecost with these
  words:</p>

<p class="scripture">"...Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain
  that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.”
  Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and
  the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?” And Peter said to
  them, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
  for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy
  Spirit. For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are
  far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself.” And with many
  other words he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, “Save
  yourselves from this crooked generation.” So <b>those who received his word
  were baptized</b>, and there were added that day about three thousand souls.
  (Acts 2:36-41) </p>

<p>It was the departing instruction of Jesus Christ to His eleven disciples to
  go and make disciples of all nations. The baptism of believers is accompanied
  by the teaching of the message of Jesus Christ. Those who accept His message
  must be baptised and must be obedient.</p>

<p class="scripture">And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven
  and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all
  nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the
  Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And
  behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age” (Matthew 28:18-20).</p>

<p>Baptism, for believers, is also a symbol of identifying with the death and
  resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class="scripture">Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into
  Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried therefore with him
  by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead
  by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life
  (Romans 6:3-4) </p>

  <h3>3. Baptism of the Holy Spirit</h3>

<p>Recall what John the Baptist told the people about the One who would come
after him: <b>He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire</b>. John the
Baptist baptised with <b>water</b> but Jesus baptised with <b>the Holy Spirit and
fire</b>. Keep in mind that the disciples of Jesus had already been born again.
We read in John 20:22 how Jesus breathed on them, saying "Receive the Holy
Spirit". Pentecost happened afterwards. Luke wrote about Pentecost as the
<b>promise of the Father</b>:
</p>

<p class="scripture">And while staying with them he ordered them not to depart
from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, he said, “you
heard from me; for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the
Holy Spirit not many days from now” (Acts 1:4,5).</p>

<p>In the description of what happened on the day of Pentecost, we read again
about the fire that was prophesied. This kind of baptism was initiated by the
Holy Spirit and it's purpose was to enable the disciples to boldly proclaim
the good news about Jesus Christ. Up to this stage, the Jews were not concerned
about the salvation of the nations but this was about to change. God elected
Israel for a purpose, much greater than the preservation of their own identity.
Christ, the Messiah, came to save the whole world from their sins.
</p>

<p class="scripture">When the day of Pentecost arrived, they were all together
in one place. And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing
wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. And divided
tongues as of fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them. And they
were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the
Spirit gave them utterance. (Acts 2:1-4) </p>

<p>After the day of Pentecost, the disciples continued to teach the Jews that
the same Jesus they had crucified came to fulfil the prophecies in the
Scripture about the promised Messiah. In Acts 4 we continue to read how Peter
and John boldly proclaimed the message of the resurrection of the dead. Their
preaching was followed by prayer and everyone that was there continued to
witness the work of the Holy Spirit.
</p>

<p class="scripture">And when they had prayed, the place in which they were
gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and
continued to speak the word of God with boldness (Acts 4:31). </p>

<p>When Paul arrived at Ephesus, he came across disciples who were baptised by
John the Baptist. These disciples were not yet taught about the Holy Spirit.
Paul then explained to them that the baptism of John actually pointed to Jesus
who baptised with the Holy Spirit. They gladly received Paul's message!
</p>

<p class="scripture">On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord
Jesus. And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them,
and they began speaking in tongues and prophesying (Acts 19:5-6).

  <p>Jesus laid his hands on sick people and by the authority of His Word they
    were healed. Through this ministry, Jesus demonstrated his love and
    compassion to the world. People learned that God really cared.

    were sick with various diseases brought them to him, and he laid his hands
    on every one of them and healed them (Luke 4:40).
  </p>
  <p class="scripture">Then came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by
    name, and seeing him, he fell at his feet and implored him earnestly, saying,
    “My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her,
    so that she may be made well and live. And he went with him” (Mark 5:22-24a).
  </p>
  <p class="scripture">When Jesus saw her, he called her over and said to her,
    “Woman, you are freed from your disability.” And he laid his hands on her,
    and immediately she was made straight, and she glorified God (Luke 13:12,13).
  </p>

  <p>The caring ministry of Jesus was continued by his disciples. The Holy
  Spirit living in the disciples enabled them to show everyone that God was alive
  and still desired to transform human lives. The disciples laid their hands on
  people so that they would receive the Holy Spirit. In the church, today, the

  <h2 class="article-subheading">THE RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD</h2>
<<<<<<< HEAD
  
=======

  <p>The resurrection of Jesus from the dead and the subsequent pouring out
    of the Holy Spirit was the birth of the church. However, these events
    also distinguished Christianity from all known religions on earth. It was
    not just another attempt of human kind to reach out to God in order to
    gain some kind of acceptance. No human being was involved in the
    resurrection, rather, it was the loving and gracious initiative of God to
    reach out to all peoples. All people were completely seperated from God
    because of sin and everyone desperately needed God's intervention to give
    hope to a dying world. The resurrection of Jesus was also the foundation of
    a new relationship between God and man. Christianity is not a religion, but
    a relationship that would last until eternity!
  </p>

  <p>Every part of the human life of Jesus was prophesied thousands of years
    before it happened, and the resurrection of Jesus was no acception. The way
    in which it happened was also extra-ordinary. The book of Matthew relates
    how an angel rolled away the stone at the entrance of the grave:
  </p>

  <p class="scripture">And behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of
    the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone and sat on
    it. His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. And
    for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men. But the angel
    said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was
    crucified. He is not here, for he has risen, as he said (Matthew 28:2-6a).
  </p>

  <p>In 1 Corinthians 15, the apostle Paul reflects on the mission of Jesus
    Christ, that he died for our sins but rose again on the third day. He then
    appeard to his disciples and also to many others, including <i>"more than
    five hundred brothers at one time"</i>. The resurrection of Christ is also
    our hope and first evidence of eternal life with Him.
  </p>

  <p class="scripture">But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the
    <b>firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep</b>. For as by a man came
    death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam
    all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive. But each in his own
    order: Christ the <b>firstfruits</b>, then at his coming those who belong to
    Christ (1 Corinthians 15:20-23).
  </p>

  <p>The resurrection of the believers is followed by the glorious announcement
    of a new kingdom: <i>"Then comes the end, when he delivers the kingdom to
    God the Father after destroying every rule and every authority and power.
    For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. The last
    enemy to be destroyed is death"(</i>) (1 Cor 15:24-26).
  </p>

  <p>In his letter to the Philippians, the apostle Paul says that he found <i>
    "the righteousness from God that depends on faith"</i>. The resurrection
    power of God also has a significance for our spiritual life and indicates
    the victory that Christ secured for us.
  </p>

  <p class="scripture">that I may know him and the power of his resurrection,
    and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, that by any
    means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead"
    (Philippians 3:10-11)
