      <h1>Spiritual Growth</h1>

<section class="article">
  <p class="lead" style="text-align: center">
    Young men exercise their bodies to become stronger, run faster, jumper
    higher and further and participate in a race. In the same way, we need to
    develop spiritual resilience.</p>

    <p class="scripture">Isn’t it obvious that all runners on the racetrack keep on
      running to win, but only one receives the victor’s prize? Yet each one of
      you must run the race to be victorious. A true athlete will be disciplined
      in every respect, practicing constant self-control in order to win a laurel
      wreath that quickly withers. But we run our race to win a victor’s crown
      that will last forever. For that reason, I don’t run just for exercise or
      box like one throwing aimless punches, but I train like a champion athlete.
      I subdue my body and get it under my control, so that after preaching the
      good news to others I myself won’t be disqualified.
      (1 Corinthians 9:24-27, TPT)

      Spiritual growth may be better understood by considering the things that
      cause believers to stumble. Would you look up to a church leader who
      easily loses his temper, is a very proud person, becomes easily depressed
      or despondent, is very sensitive to criticism, or has a very controlling
      nature? No. Such a person lives according to the desires of a sinful nature
      and has not yet found their spiritual identity in Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short article will not do justice to a teaching on spiritual maturity.
      It will be more helpful to point out practical steps towards spiritual
      growth.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
    <p>To growth in faith and spiritual stature, develop these habits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Attend a local church regularly</li>
      <li>Do not easily take offense when another believer corrects you</li>
      <li>Spend more time in prayer</li>
      <li>Develop a relationship with the Holy Spirit</li>
      <li>Devote regular time to read and study the Bible</li>
      <li>Read books by mature Christians who teach on various aspects of the
        Christian Life</li>
      <li>Take responsibility to serve others in any possible way</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

<div class="row">
  <p>May these words help you to persevere:</p>
  <div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1 col-sm-12 offset-sm-0">
    <p class="scripture">I have fought the good fight, I have finished the
      race, I have kept the faith (2 Timothy 4:7).</p>
    <p class="scripture">So abandon every form of evil, deceit, hypocrisy,
      feelings of jealousy and slander. In the same way that nursing infants
      cry for milk, you must intensely crave the pure spiritual milk of God’s
      Word. For this “milk” will cause you to grow into maturity, fully
      nourished and strong for life— especially now that you have had a taste
      of the goodness of Yahweh and have experienced his kindness
      (1 Peter 2:1-3).</p>
