        <p>The book of Revelation describes the final judgment, also called the
           '<b>white throne judgment</b>'. It is the condemnation of the ungodly
           to a lake of fire.
        </p>
        <p class="scripture">
          Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. From his
          presence earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them. And
          I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books
          were opened. Then another book was opened, which is the book of life.
          And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according
          to what they had done. And the sea gave up the dead who were in it,
          Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them, and they were
          judged, each one of them, according to what they had done. Then Death
          and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death,
          the lake of fire. And if anyone's name was not found written in the
          book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire. (Revelation 20:11-15)
        </p>
        <p>People who only have a superficial knowledge of the Bible would
          question the severity of such a judgment. However, the crucifixion of
          God's only Son was also severe. Jesus Christ took on Himself the
          sin of the world (John 1:29) so that He could endure the wages of
          sin on our behalf. This was the price that Jesus paid to give us the
          gift of eternal life (Romans 6:22-23).
        </p>
        <p>
          The doctrine of Eternal Judgment can only be understood by
          grasping the holiness of Jahweh. His uprightness and purity is so
          brilliant in perfection, it is far removed and completely seperated
          from sin. Read the prophet Isaiah's vision of the Lord and the affect
          the vision had on him (Isaiah 6:1-6).

          We read in Acts 17:30-31 that God "commands all people everywhere to
          repent, because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in
          righteousness". God ordained from the beginning that sin be judged. It
          is imperitive that we understand who God is. His holiness draws us
          into devoted relationship with Him. There is no compromise and no
          excuse. The history of Israel tells us how God hates sin and how
          He desires complete devotion to him.
        </p>
        <p>The Bible teaches about the "Day of judgement", a specific day when
          everybody will be held accountable.
        </p>
        <p class="scripture">I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give
          account for every careless word they speak, for by your words you will
          be justified, and by your words you will be condemned” (Matthew 12:36).
        </p>
        <p class="scripture">
          “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him,
          then he will sit on his glorious throne. Before him will be gathered
          all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a
          shepherd separates the sheep from the goats" (Matthew 25:31-32).
        </p>
        <p class="scripture">
          Then he will answer them, saying, 'Truly, I say to you, as you did not
          do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.' And these
          will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal
          life (Matthew 25:45-46).
        </p>
        <p>The miraculous rescue of Noah and his family from the flood was
          symbolic of the hope that the righteous have in an unrighteous world.
          The rest of the ancient world at that time were destroyed by the
          flood. Similarly, Lot was rescued while Sodom and Gomorrah was
          "condemned to extinction, making them an example of what is going
          to happen to the ungodly" (2 Peter 2:6).
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Here is the lessons for us today: "if he rescued righteous Lot"
        (2 Peter 2:7), "then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from
        trials, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of
        judgment" (2 Peter 2:9).
