  <h2 class="article-subheading">FAITH IN GOD</h2>

  <p>An indisputable part of our Christian foundation is FAITH IN GOD.</p>

  <p class="scripture">Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as
    righteousness (James 2:23).</p>

  <p>Faith implies a measure of personal trust in something beyond your natural
    reasoning and abilities. From childhood, we become independent and
    take responsibility for our own safety, provision and well-being. We learn
    to rely on our own judgement. Trusting God for your salvation challenges the
    securities with which I surrounded my life. Consider the implications of
    this proverb: </p>

  <p class="scripture">Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on
    your own understanding (Proverbs 3:5). </p>

  <p>Faith is directly related to the proclamation of the word of Christ. It is
    the testimony of many Christians that their lives were deeply affected when
    they believed in God. When I encountered Christ as a young man at
    university, I experienced an instant transformation. I responded to the
    inner conviction of the Holy Spirit by praying the most important prayer I
    ever prayed, inviting Jesus into my life. After I prayed, I truly believed.
    I knew that I changed and that my life would never be the same again.
  </p>

  <p class="scripture">For “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be
  saved.” How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how
  are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to
  hear without someone preaching? And how are they to preach unless they are
  sent? As it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the
  good news!” But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, “Lord,
  who has believed what he has heard from us?” So faith comes from hearing, and
  hearing through the word of Christ (Romans 10:13-17).</p>

  <p>We exercise faith to trust God for our salvation. Then, throughout our
  lives, faith is an essential part of our living and breathing as God's
  children. Whenever we pray, we trust God that He will reward those who
  earnestly seek him.
  </p>

  <p class="scripture">And without faith it is impossible to please him, for
  whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards
  those who seek him (Hebrews 11:6) </p>

  <p class="discussion-heading">Recommended for discussion:
    <ul class="discussion-points">
      <li>Share with each other how your faith has been tested, and the
        evidence that you are muturing in faith.</li>
      <li>To what extent has faith matured in your life?</li>
      <li>How would you explain the concept of faith to an unbeliever?</li>
    </ul>
