<h3>1. The baptism of John the Baptist</h3>

<p class="scripture">Now John wore a garment of camel's hair and a leather belt
   around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. Then Jerusalem
   and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were going out to him, and
   <b>they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins</b>
   (Matthew 3:4-6, ESV)</p>

<p>The baptism of John was a prophetic event, proclaiming the arrival of
   someone much greater than he. He warned the people of Israel to repent of
   their sins and turn away from evil so that their sins may be forgiven. When
   some thought that John could be the Christ, he answered them:

<p class="scripture">I baptize you with water, but he who is mightier than I
   is coming, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. <b>He will
   baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire</b> (Luke 3:16, ESV).</p>

<p>His ministry reached its climax when Jesus came and requested that He also
   be baptised. </p>

<p class="scripture">Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus
   also had been baptized and was praying, the heavens were opened, and the
   Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form, like a dove; and a voice came
   from heaven, â€œYou are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased
   (Luke 3:21-22, ESV).</p>
