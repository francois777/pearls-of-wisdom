      <p class="scripture">Now John wore a garment of camel's hair and a leather belt
         around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. Then Jerusalem
         and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were going out to him, and
         <b>they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins</b>
         (Matthew 3:4-6).</p>

      <p>The book of Matthew describes the unique ministry of John the Baptist, the
      one anointed by God to prepare the way of the Messiah.</p>

      <p class="scripture">In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the
        wilderness of Judea, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” For this
        is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said, “The voice of one
        crying in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of the Lord; make his paths
        straight.’” (Matthew 3:1-3)

      <p>The baptism of John was a prophetic event, proclaiming the arrival of someone
        much more significant than he. He warned the people of Israel to repent of
        their sins and turn away from evil to receive forgiveness of their sins. When
        some thought that John could be the Christ, he answered them:</p>

      <p class="scripture">I baptize you with water, but he who is mightier than I
         is coming, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. <b>He will
         baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire</b> (Luke 3:16).</p>

      <p>His ministry reached its climax when Jesus came and requested that He also
         be baptised. </p>

      <p class="scripture">Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus
         also had been baptized and was praying, the heavens were opened, and the
         Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form, like a dove; and a voice came
         from heaven, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased
         (Luke 3:21-22).
