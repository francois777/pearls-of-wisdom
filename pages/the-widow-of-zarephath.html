        In Israel, there lived a very evil king called Ahab. He was even worse
        than all the kings that were before him. Ahab did not choose a woman
        from Israel. He was more interested in Jezebel, a lady from a foreign
        country. Ahab's choice caused the nation Israel much trouble. King Ahab
        built an altar to the idol, Baal, and he also erected a statute for a
        goddess. His careless actions went against everything that Israel was
        supposed to believe. Therefore, it is no surprise that the whole nation
        was about to suffer because of their irresponsible king.

        God raised up a righteous man, Elijah, to pronounce judgement over
        Ahab. The Holy Spirit gave Elijah the courage to bring this message to
        Ahab: <span>"From now on, there will be neither rain,
        nor dew in your country. You, oh king, cannot do anything about it. It
        will only rain when I command rain to fall."</span> This message made
        Ahab very angry, but God extraordinarily protected Elijah. He told
        Elijah to go and hide at a brook, east of the Jordan River.

        Elijah had plenty of clean water to wash and drink, and God also planned
        for meals. He commanded the ravens to take food to Elijah - bread and meat
        in the morning and in the evening. Elijah trusted God and knew that Israel
        would repent and turn back to God after the drought. After a while,
        Elijah's faith was challenged because the persistent lack of rain caused
        the brook to dry up.
      </p>

      <p>God did not take his hand off the prophet, and Elijah was
        about to see an even greater miracle. God told Elijah to walk to
        Zarephath to find a widow. Elijah did not know how poor the widow was,
        and all he knew was that God had already told the widow to feed Elijah.

        Elijah arrived at the gate of Zarephath and saw a woman gathering
        sticks. He knew this was the widow God told him about. Elijah called the
        widow and said to her, <span>"Bring me a little water in a vessel that I
        may drink."</span> Then, Elijah added, <span>"Bring me a morsel of bread
        in your hand."</span> The woman did not yet understand Elijah and had
        little faith. Elijah had
        no idea that he was asking her for her last food. The widow told Elijah
        about her predicament: "As the LORD your God lives, I have nothing
        baked, only a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug. And
        now I am gathering a couple of sticks that I may go in and prepare it
        for myself and my son, that we may eat it and die." She actually
        tried to explain to Elijah that she and her son would die of hunger after
        eating their last meal.

        Elijah had no intention to rob that lady, and God revealed his plan to
        Elijah. The prophet spoke words of comfort and hope to the widow: <span>
        "Do not fear; go and do as you have said. But first make me a little
        cake of it and bring it to me, and afterward make something for yourself
        and your son. For thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, ‘The jar of
        flour shall not be spent, and the jug of oil shall not be empty, until
        the day that the LORD sends rain upon the earth.’"</span> Amazingly, God
        promised to provide for the widow until the drought had ended.
      </p>
      <p>
        It happened just as Elijah had told the widow. She could feed Elijah,
        and there was abundant food in her house until the drought ended. Amid
        crisis and distress, God provided abundantly in an impossible situation.
        Moreover, God's revelation of goodness to the home of the widow did not
        end here. He allowed a very distressing sickness to come over the
        widow's son. The boy became so sick that he could hardly breath.

    <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
      <p>
        Because the woman's faith was so small, she turned against the prophet
        and said: <span>"You have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance and
        to cause the death of my son!".</span> Elijah was also very disturbed
        and knew they needed to trust God again for a miracle. He asked the woman
        to hand her son to him, and he took the child upstairs to his room.
        Elijah cried to God, and he showed his faith by stretching himself on
        the child, praying earnestly, <span>"O LORD my God, let this child's
        life come into him again."</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        God heard the outcry of Elijah and healed the child completely. Elijah
        took the child downstairs with gratefulness, handing his mother a
        healthy child. When the widow saw what happened, she really believed and
        said to Elijah: <span>"Now I know that you are a man of God, and that
        the word of the LORD in your mouth is truth."</span> The house was
        filled with gladness, and the three of them shared a meal with grateful
        hearts.

  <p>Continue to read in 1 Kings 18 how Elijah appeared before
    king Ahab in the third year of the drought. God dealt with the arrogant Baal
    prophets in a spectacular fashion.
