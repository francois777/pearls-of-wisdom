<h1>Hearing the Shepherd's Voice</h1>

<section class="article">
  <p class="lead">
    The Bible introduces us to the metaphor of the shepherd and his sheep. The
    Shepherd in the Scriptures is no ordinary caretaker. He bonds with the sheep
    as a mother bonds with her new-born child, showing affection, nurturing their
    needs, and gently guiding them to safety. As a baby finds comfort by hearing
    her mother's voice, so does the child of God respond to the voice of their
    Heavenly Father. Our Shepherd does not see a flock but individual sheep who
    have unique names. He tells them apart and knows their distinct needs.

        He will tend his flock like a shepherd; he will gather the lambs in his
        arms; he will carry them in his bosom, and gently lead those that are with
        young. (Isaiah 40:11)
      </p>
      <p class="scripture large">
        My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me (John 10:27).

      <p class="scripture large">
        The sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads
        them out. When he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and
        the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. I am the good shepherd. The
        good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep (John 10:3-4,11)
