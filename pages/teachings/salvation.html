<h1>How can I be saved?</h1>

<section class="article">
  <p class="lead">
    Very early in my Christian walk, I enrolled for a one-year programme with
    Youth for Christ, South Africa. One of our important commitments was to
    travel, as a group, to a crowded area in a large city. We would sing together
    at places where crowds could gather. The people that were not singing
    introduced themselves to people in the crowd and handed them a little
    yellow booklet called, <b><em>The Four Spiritual Laws</em></b>. We would
    explain these significant laws with people and help them to receive Jesus
    Christ as their personal Saviour.

      <p>I want to introduce you to the content of this yellow track, but I first
        want to talk to you about salvation. The question that sooner or later
        confronts every person is <b>How can I be saved?</b>. The mission of Jesus
        Christ, the Son of God, was extraordinary. He left His Heavenly dwelling to
        become a human being. This is the story of God, reaching out to human
        beings. When we are confronted with the reality of this historical event, the
        Holy Spirit convicts us, deep inside, that we need to respond to this message.
      </p>
      <p>Have you responded yet to the message of Jesus Christ? If this has not
        happened yet in your life, do you know how to respond to him? Maybe, you
        have already made this important decision, but you want to help a friend or
        stranger to make this commitment. Do you know how to help someone to
        invite Jesus into their life?

      <p>The following link will take you directly to the contents of this booklet.

      <p>Let us take a look at the four steps:
        <ol class="spiritual-laws">
          <li><b>Step 1:</b> God loves you and created you to know Him personally.
          </li>
          <li><b>Step 2:</b> Man is sinful and separated from God, so we cannot know
            Him personally or experience His love.</li>
          <li><b>Step 3:</b> Jesus Christ is God's only provision for man's sin.
            Through Him alone we can know God personally and experience God's love.
          </li>
          <li><b>Step 4:</b> We must individually receive Jesus Christ as Savior and
            Lord; then we can know God personally and experience His love.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Each of the four steps are deeply grounded in the Word of God. Take time to
        become familiar with the contents and all the included Bible references. It
        is also important to know that after we invited Jesus into our lives, we
        need to commit ourselves to a group of believers. To keep on growing as
        disciples, we need to seek the fellowship of other believers.

    <p>If you would like more guidance on starting a personal relationship with
      Jesus, consider one of the following actions:
    </p>
    <ul class="response-actions">
      <li>Contact Francois at francoisvdhoven@protonmail.com</li>
      <li>Visit the website of <b>HeartLife Church</b> in Narangba. Click here
        to open the website: <a href="https://www.heartlifechurch.com.au/"
        target="_blank">HeartLife Church Website</a>, then open the contact page
        and submit a request to be contacted.</li>
      <li>Visit a Bible-believing church and connect with the leaders.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A word of caution: If a church holds to modern, liberal theology,
      opposing a literal interpretation of the Bible, don't go there. Let me
      clarify. The Bible communicates to people according to the normal rules of
      a language. All Scripture should be taken literally unless the context of
      the text obviously presents itself in a different genre, for example poetry,
      proverbs, idioms, parables, or other figures of speech. We should not
      read our own imaginative ideas into the Bible, but allow the Bible to
      speak for itself.
