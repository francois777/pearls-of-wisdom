  <p class="lead">
    The Word of God gives life and hope in a world that seems to have no
    direction and offers no hope for the future. Followers of Jesus Christ
    have found hope for two thousand years, because in Him we have found an
    anchor in stormy seas. We will pursue this hope with body, mind and soul so
    that we persevere until the Day of the Lord.

  <p class="scripture" style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.4em">
    What delight comes to the one who follows God’s ways!</br>
    He won’t walk in step with the wicked,</br>
    nor share the sinner’s way,</br>
    nor be found sitting in the scorner’s seat.</br>
    His passion is to remain true to the Word of “I AM,”</br>
    meditating day and night on the true revelation of light.</br>
    He will be standing firm like a flourishing tree</br>
    planted by God’s design,</br>
    deeply rooted by the brooks of bliss,</br>
    bearing fruit in every season of life.</br>
    He is never dry, never fainting,</br>
    ever blessed, ever prosperous.</br>
    (Psalm 1:1-3, TPT)
